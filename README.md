    <h1>Welcome to TrailQuest!🌲</h1>
    <h2>What is TrailQuest?</h2>
    <p>TrailQuest is an all-purpose hiking desktop application designed to connect hikers, share experiences, display nearby locations, and track hiking progress and adventures.</p>
    <h2>System Requirements 🖥️</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Low power or above computing power🤖</li>
      <li>JDK 20+♨️</li>
      <li>A stable Internet connection 🌐</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How does it work?🤔</h2>
    <p>Upon opening the application, you create an account with 2 security questions, after which your password is encrypted and stored within the database. After this, the user can log in where they are greeted by the Main GUI.</p>

    <p>The Main GUI loads with the location of the user (via IP address), which is processed and used to show the user the nearest 25 locations to their location. If a user has a level of security where the IP cannot be resolved, then the default location is Los Angeles, California. The user can then opt to enter a different location in the query boxes to display hiking locations nearby to that location instead.</p>
