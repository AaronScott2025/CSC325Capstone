Welcome to Trail Quest!


What is TrailQuest?

TrailQuest is an All-purpose Hiking Desktop Application, that serves to connect Hikers together to share their experiences, show the user locations near them, and allows the user to track their hiking progress, and experiences.

System Requirements:

  -Low power or above computing power
  -JDK 20+
  -A stable Inernet Connection

How does it work?

Upon opening the application, you create an account with 2 security questions, after which your password is encrypted, and stored within the database. After this, the user can log in where they are greeted to the Main GUI. 

The Main GUI loads with the location of the user  (Via IP address), which is processed, and used to show the user the nearest 25 locations to their location. If a user has a level of security where the IP cannot be resolved, then the default location is Los Angeles, California. The user can then opt to enter a different location in the query boxes to display hiking locations nearby to that location instead.

The user can clock on the "Activity Feed" button, to see posts from other users within the program. 

The user can access the Hiking log functionality, which the user can use to track their hikes.
